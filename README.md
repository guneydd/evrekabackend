question 1 answers are on results,
question 2 answers are on results2,
for question 1 optimization there can be a scheduled service which works every hour and stores the data in a database table and then when results needed
by simply making select all from that table one can reach the result he needs.
In addition diagram.png available for both questions. Which was also generated by a django extension. I hope that was all about this task:)
Cheers
